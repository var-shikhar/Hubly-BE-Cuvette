# HUBLY - Backend

## Overview

The backend of HUBLY handles scheduling, user management, and event processing. It ensures seamless communication between the frontend and the database, while also maintaining error logging for better debugging.

## Features

### Event & Scheduling Management

- Manages event creation, updating, and deletion.
- Checks for availability conflicts before scheduling.

### User Management

- Handles authentication and user profiles.
- Stores and retrieves user availability settings.

### Logging System

- Logs errors and stores them in a designated folder for debugging.
- Ensures better tracking of backend issues.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (Database)

### Additional Tools

- **Winston** (for logging errors)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the backend locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/var-shikhar/HUBLY-event-mangement-BE-Cuvette.git
cd HUBLY-event-mangement-BE-Cuvette

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables template and configure settings
cp .env.example .env

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

## Usage & Code Structure

### Modularized Codebase

- The backend is structured for better maintainability and scalability.
- Routes, controllers, and services are organized into separate modules.

### Logging System

- Uses `Winston` for error logging.
- Logs are stored in a designated folder for debugging and monitoring.

### Authentication & Security

- Uses JWT for secure authentication.
- Implements refresh tokens for maintaining user sessions.
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt with a defined salt.
